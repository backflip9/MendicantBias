  "storm" : "The Storm (Halo 3) on the Easy difficulty is the greatest level (IL) to speedrun. The combat is perfect, (no rng) the movement is clean, you get help from your allies, (marines) and you get to do a cool skip! (Scarab skip) Then you WALK for 40 seconds to the end and do a cross map shot to end the level. (The Storm) How could anyone think that this level, (The Storm) is bad? It's my favorite level, (IL) in the entire game! (Halo 3)",
  "craig" : "What.  The.  FUCK?!?!  34HeadFuckin3 has yet again come out with ANOTHER goddamn update, and what did it do you ask?  ODST is now on pc.  Fucking brilliant, of all thing, that's what gets added??  NO.  ONE.  CARES!!!  BUT WAIT!! That's not all...not only did they add something that no one give a rat's ass about, but whadaya know?  THEY FUCKED UP SHIT IN MY HALO 3 SPEEDRUN™!!!  The AI is busted to all hell.  I have put over 50,000 goddamn hours into this shit, AND THEY GO AHEAD AND PUT FUCKING CRAIG IN THE GODDAMN JETPACK CLEAR?!?!?  Do they not realize how important EVERY SECOND is on the easy difficulty??  Every mother fucking AI now has 2Head levels on mechanics, my fucking hermit crab could program a better code.  Fucks sake 343, every fucking record on HaloRuns™ is now impossible to beat because of your incompetent team of high school dropouts.  Fuck you.",
